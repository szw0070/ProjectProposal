# Life as a Scatterhoarder: Would you survive?

## Objective
To create a command line based game that leads players 
    through the life of a squirrel during fall and winter.

## Short summary of game
The goal of the game is to survive through the end of winter.
    This will be done by deciding how to split time between
    watching for predators, resting, and foraging for food.
    Foraging for food also has a lot of steps that include
    scatterhoarding food to eat during winter.
    Each action chosen will add to or subtract from the 
    "life stats" of the squirrel (predation risk, exhaustion level,
    and hunger). If any stat exceeds its max level, the squirrel dies.
    At the end of each "turn" (certain terminal decisions),
    the squirrel may or may not meet a predator (based on the 
    predation risk stat) and may or may not escape the predator
    (based on the total of all life stats).

## Goals
1.  Add all possible actions to the dictionary along with how they 
    affect the different life stats levels
2.  Create variables for the life stats that change value when 
    different actions are selected.
3.  Add "predation events" that create a random number and
    compare to numbers in life stats to determine if squirrel dies or not.
4.  Figure out how to let players choose where to search for 
    previously buried seeds.
I have a lot of little steps in between these that I want to do, but I think
these are the highlights.
